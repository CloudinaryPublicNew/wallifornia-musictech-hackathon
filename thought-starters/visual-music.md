Imagine having a photo in front of you come to life with sounds. Every photo has a scene, a potential emotion attached to it. You can very easily  discover objects and interesting items within a scene using [Cloudinary's Auto Tagging](../cloudinary/categorizing-images.md) capability and then use that information to trigger aural cues for example have the [sound of a drum](https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/sound-library/) play when recognised in the scene.

## Choose a Serverless Stack

Resist the urge to create an Express app from scratch and deploy a server for this one! Instead, focus on building on Auth0 extend's FaaS serverless stack. You'll be able to quickly create use and deploy Cloudinary's API's and extend it further with other APIs. Then call each API directly within a Single Page App \(SPA\) to take advantage of the responsive design possibilities.

Cloudinary's APIs work extremely well with Auth0 [Webtasks](https://webtask.io) and other serverless platforms. We support many languages, including JavaScript and [Node.js](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration).

### Use This Guide to Get Started {#use-this-guide-to-get-started}

We've organized the Cloudinary resources in this guide by functionality so you can quickly add a feature to your application. Each article is a short and concise walkthrough, so you won't have to comb too deep through our extensive [documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation), unless you want to.

### Tweet/Share your Experience {#tweet-share-your-experience}
