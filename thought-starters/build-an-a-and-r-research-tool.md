# Build an A&R research tool

![Visualize sales geographically](../.gitbook/assets/choropleth.png)

Use the data provided by [the Bandcamp API](https://bandcamp.com/developer) to allow managers to visualize the popularity of their band [geographically, in a heatmap](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606). Compare artistâ€™s sales between each other to identify unique pockets of momentum.

### Resources:

* [The Bandcamp API](https://bandcamp.com/developer)
* [A choropleth visualization template](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606) using [D3.js](https://d3js.org)

### Choose a Serverless Stack

Resist the urge to create an Express app from scratch and deploy a server for this one! Instead, focus on extending our[ Blueprint starter  application](https://cloudinary.gitbook.io/cil-hackathon-guide/~/edit/primary/thought-starters/immersive-wayne-shorter-catalog)  built on Auth0 extend's FaaS serverless stack. .  You'll be able to quickly use our API's example endpoints or extend it further with other APIs.  Then call each API directly within a Single Page App \(SPA\) to take advantage of the responsive design possibilities.

Cloudinary's APIs work elegantly with Auth0 [Webtasks](https://webtask.io) and other serverless platforms. We support many languages, including JavaScript and [Node.js](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration).

### Use This Guide to Get Started

We've organized the Cloudinary resources in this guide by functionality so you can quickly add a feature to your application. Each article is a short and concise walkthrough, so you won't have to comb too deep through our extensive [documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation), unless you want to.

### Tweet/Share your Experience

We know your Hackathon experience will be fun and engaging. Don't forget to share that with your friends on social media. _**In fact, we've added links at the top of this guide to make sharing easy.**_. Learning about visualizing an audio waveform? Show the world what you are working on and let them learn about these cool technologies, right along with you.
