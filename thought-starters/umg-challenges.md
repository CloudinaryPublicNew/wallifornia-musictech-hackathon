# UMG Challenges

1. Build an immersive catalog experience for Wayne Shorter
2. Build an A&R Research Tool that can help us identify the small pockets of momentum globally. \(e.g. Heat map of band camp data / live metrics\)  
3. Build a tool to help improve licensing / rights management processes \(optional incorporate Blockchain\)
4. Other strategic priorities for UMG:  Bots, messaging, gamification \| Playlisting tools \| Unique artist marketing tools
5. AR/VR - UMG's Music to create 3D mixes and interactive, 3D experiences for an Augmented Reality \(AR\) platform we are building. VR database of playabale music
6. Voice – Create skills that uniquely drive music discovery by voice
7. Spotify hack – we’ve gotten lots of complaints that artists are unable to share a specific track of their via a playlist link. Instead when they share, it just takes you to the top of the playlist page rather than direct to streaming. Not a full time project most likely but if anyone can figure this out as a side project, this request has come our way from senior management
8. Create fun applications that merge video and music
